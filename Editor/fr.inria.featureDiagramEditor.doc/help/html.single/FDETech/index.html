It is
      divided into two parts, the graphical feature diagram editor himself and a Praxis plugin
      constraints. This feature diagram editor take into account different notations about feature
      models and separate features model and base domain models on which it apply.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="d0e57"></a>Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Choices made on this feature diagram editor</h2></div></div></div><p></p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e61"></a>1.1.&nbsp; Feature Diagram Editor</h2></div></div></div><p>We choose to create a graphical feature diagram editor as an Eclipse plugin. This
        graphical editor must take into account the following elements : features, decomposition
        edge such as and, or, xor, card, attributes which can permit to associate metadata on a
        feature to facilitate the selection into its sons, and a direct mapping with elements from
        viewpoint model (base model from variability) with addition of model elements from these
        viewpoint model into the features. These model elements can be any element stored into a
        model based on EMF (and ecore). </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e66"></a>1.2.&nbsp; Constraints plugin</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to the feature diagram editor, a plugin constraints was developed in order
        to help user to create valid feature models. This plugin is written using Praxis rules.
        Then, we present the rules created on this plugin : </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>noTwoFeaturesHaveSameName : Feature has the same name of another feature in the
              feature diagram.</p></li><li><p>noParentFeatureAsChildren : The feature children cannot contain their parent
              feature.</p></li><li><p>noMutexBetweenParentAndChild : There cannot be mutual exclusivity between a
              feature parent and one of its child.</p></li><li><p>noSeveralMutexOnSameFeature : There cannot have several mutex between the same
              pair of features. </p></li><li><p>noCyclesOnRequire : For two features f1, if f1 requires f2, f2 cannot requires
              f1.</p></li><li><p>noBothRequireAndMutexOnSameFeatures : There cannot have both mutex and require
              constraints between the same pair of features.</p></li><li><p> minCardLargerThanZero : Cardinality minimum on operator card on feature must be
              equal or larger than zero.</p></li><li><p>noMinGreaterThanMax : Cardinality maximum on operator card on feature must be
              equal and greater than cardinality minimum. </p></li><li><p>noMaxLessThanMinusOne : Cardinality maximum on operator card on a given feature
              must be greater and equal than minus one.</p></li><li><p>nbFeaturesMustBeMoreThanMin : The number of children features of the operator Card
              on the feature must be equal or more than the minimum cardinality. </p></li><li><p>orOperatorMustHaveAtLeastTwoOperands : The or operator on the feature must have at
              least two features children.</p></li><li><p>alternativeOperatorMustHaveAtLeastTwoOperands : The Xor operator on the feature
              must have at least two features children.</p></li><li><p>noAncestorFeatureAsChildren : a child feature cannot have one of these ancestors
              as children.</p></li><li><p>noConstraintReflexive : Agiven feature cannot require itself or be mutually
              exclusive with itself.</p></li><li><p>noMutexBetweenMandatoryFeatureChildren : features with the same feature parent and
              containec in an and operator cannot be mutually exclusive.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="d0e117"></a>Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Metamodel used </h2></div></div></div><p> This section consists in a quick presentation of the metamodel used to create the feature
      diagram editor. The following picture presents this metamodel.</p><p>
      <img src="FDETech_figures/featureDiagram.png"></p><p>On this section we will present the feature diagram metamodel used in this tool (cf
      metamodel above). FeatureDiagram is the root class of the metamodel. This class has an
      attribute graphTypeTree which permits to determines whether if the feature disgram is a tree
      feature diagram or a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It also contains a list of features (class
      Feature) which are represented in the feature diagram as a node. The special root node r is
      identify by the reference root from FeatureDiagram to Feature. In the metamodel, these
      operators are subtype of the class Operator, and each feature (class Feature) contains 0 or
      more operators. The class Feature also contains a list of edges (class Edge) allowing the
      construction of the setDE of decomposition edges. The set CE of constraint edges is
      represented in the metamodel by the class ConstraintEdge and they are contained by the class
      FeatureDiagram. Each ConstraintEdge contains either a Require constraint or a Mutex
      constraint. Model elements from the base model are stored directly on the Feature metaclass
      with the modelElements reference. To conclude the Attribute metaclass defines an attribute
      that we can add on a feature in order to store informations used to determines whether child
      must be selected. For example, we can add an attribute with the name of a country in a feature
      and choose to select one of the children feature according to this country. </p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="d0e127"></a>Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Limitation of the current version</h2></div></div></div><p>A future version will permit to not display all parts of the feature diagram at the same
